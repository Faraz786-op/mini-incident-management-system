# üöÄ Mini Incident Management System - ServiceNow

This is a mini project created in ServiceNow to simulate a simple Incident Management System.  
It covers basic Incident functionalities like creating incidents, assigning, resolving, email notifications, reporting, and dashboarding.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Create and manage Mini Incidents.
- Auto-generate Incident Number (INC0010001, INC0010002, etc.)
- Impact, Urgency, and automatic Priority calculation (1-High, 2-Moderate, 3-Low).
- Business Rules to update resolved fields.
- Email notification sent to "Assigned To" user.
- Two reports created:
  - Incidents Created per Day
  - Incidents by State
- Dashboard displaying both reports.
- GitHub version-controlled project with documentation and screenshots.

## üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **ServiceNow** (Yokohama version)
- **Flow Designer / Business Rules**
- **Email Notifications**
- **Reports and Dashboards**
- **GitHub** for version control

## üìã Business Rules

- **BR Set Resolved Info:**  
  When the Incident is moved to the Resolved state:

  - Set Resolved At = Current Date/Time

- **BR Send Assignment Email:**  
  When an Incident is assigned:
  - Send email notification to "Assigned To" user.

## üìä Reports Created

- **Incidents Created per Day Report**  
  (List of all Incidents Created per Day)

- **Incidents by State Report**  
  (Pie Chart showing Incident distribution per state)

---

## üìà Dashboard

- **Mini Incident Dashboard** created showing:
  - Incidents Created Day by Day
  - Incidents by State

## üîÑ REST Integration Demo

This project includes a basic REST integration using [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to simulate sending incident data to an external endpoint.

### ‚úîÔ∏è How It Works
- A REST Message is triggered via Business Rule whenever an incident is updated.
- JSON payload is posted to an external endpoint with details like:
  - Incident Number
  - Short Description
  - State

### üì∏ Screenshots

| Description                    | Screenshot |

| Business Rule Script           | ![Business Rule](screenshots/business_rule_rest_call.png) |
| Webhook Response Received      | ![Webhook](screenshots/webhook_response.png) |


## üéØ Future Enhancements

- Add Flow Designer automation for Notifications.
- Add SLAs for resolution times based on Impact/Urgency.
- Create Service Catalog Item for submitting Mini Incidents.
- Role-based access control (ACLs).
